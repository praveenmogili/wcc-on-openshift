# Running Oracle Webcenter Content in Openshift

## Overview
Oracle Webcenter content server runs on top of Oracle Fusion Middleware Java container and requires a database to store the content and metadata for this purpose we need Oracle Database server.

This means we need to build two docker containers 
1. Oracle DB Container (version 12.2.0.1)
2. Oracle FMW Container (version 12.2.1.4)

## Openshift Login / Access Setup

As a pre-requisite steps:
1. Validate login to Openshift Dashboard. Refer:
[Intro to Openshift](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/getting_started/developers/developers_console.html)
2. Validate `oc` CLI login. There are several steps which are performed from `oc` CLI which require you to be logged in to opeshift,
As described here : 
[Link to RedHat OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html)

please make sure you can login to the Openshift Dashboard and copy the login token as shown:

![login Token secret](imgs/token.png)

After copying the login command you can paste in a shell to access the OC CLI. Here is an example below:

```
$ oc login https://vmdocker02.mythics.lab:8443 --token=am8BpXVkgS8h0WycY09teFxmIQJgfKG2zmlUQo534GI
```

## Build Docker Images

### Building Oracle Database Image 

This image can be imported directly into Openshift from Oracle Container Registry (container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1) [Link to Oracle](https://container-registry.oracle.com/)

First create a secret for connecting to this registry.
Either using oc CLI as shown below:


```
$ oc secret new-dockercfg \
    --docker-server=privateregistry.example.com \
    --docker-username=developer@example.com \
    --docker-password=******** \
    --docker-email=unused \
    private-registry
```


or from GUI

![Create secret](imgs/secret.png)


Once the oracle container registy is linked successfully import the database and instantclient images using the following:


`$ oc import image container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1 --confirm`

`$ oc import-image container-registry.oracle.com/database/instantclient:12.2.0.1 --confirm`

 next step is to create the Database server image and test the connectivity as follows.

### Create the Database Deployment in Openshift

![Create Database Deployment](imgs/dbdeploy1.png)

Provide a name for the deployemnt and then follow the next screen.

![Create Database Environment](imgs/dbdeploy2.png)

Once all the environment variables are entered save it and click deploy.
Next navigate to pods screen 

![Pods Screen ](imgs/dbdeploy3.png)

After about 10-15 minutes the database service should be up and running. You can track the progress of the install in the pods logs tab

![Pods Logs Screen ](imgs/dbdeploy4.png)



### Test the Database Service and Connectivity

Oracle provides a thin instantclient docker image to use sqlplus command from a container. This is useful in debugging and testing the database connectivity between pods.
Using a similar procedure to database import the instantclient image.
Run this image in a termianl and connect to the database to test the connectivity.

![DB Connectivity Check ](imgs/dbconnect1.png)


This step validates the database is running correctly in Openshift so that we can proceed to the next step of setting up Java container and installing the Webcenter content server.

### Building Webcenter Docker Image

Webcenter Docker Image Needs to be built on a Linux Machine as described in the next section.
#### Clone this Repository

1. Navigate to a local directory where you want to clone this repository
2. Run this command in a terminal: `git clone git@github.com:praveenmogili/wcc-on-openshift.git`

Alternatively, you can download the entire repository as a zip file by [clicking here](https://github.com/praveenmogili/wcc-on-openshift/archive/master.zip).

#### Download the wcc binary zip file
1. Download the binary zip from [here](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/webcenter-content-download.html) and place in this location: `[CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY]/wcc/fmw_12.2.1.4.0_wccontent_Disk1_1of1.zip`

#### Build the wcc docker image
1. Navigate to  `wcc/` folder in your local cloned repository directory
2. Run this command in a terminal: `docker build .`
3. You should eventually(~ 15-20 minutes later) see a message indicating success:

#### Push the wcc docker image to openshift

There are a couple of ways to achieve this:
1. Upload the image to a public docker registry like quay.io or docker.github.com and then link your credentials to openshift secret 
2. Directly from the local machine or local private(insecure) docker registry. Below is an example of this:
   
```
$ oc import-image --insecure <image_stream_name>[:<tag>] --from=<docker_image_repo> --confirm

--insecure switch is needed if it is running on a self-signed private registry
```

Once this is done successfully, you should be able to see this in openshift as follows:
```

## WCC Deployment in Openshift

### Create the wcc Deployment in Openshift

Now, its time to deploy WCC application in Openshift. Click Deploy Image as shown below and select the wccontent image stream uploaded above.

![WCC Deploy 1 ](imgs/wcc-deploy1.png)

### Create the Persistent Storage and Attach it to the deployment
Add persistent storage for domain configuration data and log files.

![WCC Storage ](imgs/wcc-storage1.png)
Then attach it in the deployment configuration as shown below:

![WCC Storage ](imgs/wcc-storage2.png)
### Create the Environment Variable
Based on the *wcc.env* file create the environment for WCC app

![WCC Environment ](imgs/wcc-environ.png)

### Deploy the WCC Pod
Deploy the application and watch the logs for the pods to finish (takes anywhere from 15-20 minutes)

![WCC Pod Logs ](imgs/wcc-podlogs.png)

Once you see the pod running, 

![WCC Pod Run ](imgs/wcc-podrun.png)
its time to create the service and routes to access the application from the browser.

### Create the WCC Services in Openshift
Create services based on the file in `wcc/wcc.yml` downloaded above using the command:
`$ oc apply -f wcc.yml`

### Create the Routes for Weblogic Admin and Webcenter Content in Openshift

Create two route for the WCC application:
1. for Weblogic admin console for the port 7001 
![WCC Route1 ](imgs/wcc-admin-route.png)
2. for WCC application for the port 16200
![WCC Route2 ](imgs/wcc-app-route.png)

## Accessing the Application 
Accessing the console for first time will deploy the application and redirect you to weblogc login page. 

![WCC App1 ](imgs/app1.png)
Use the credentials provided in  

![WCC App2 ](imgs/app2.png)
Weblogic admin portal:

![WCC App3 ](imgs/app3.png)
Accessing the WCC app for first will ask you to select configuration options and restart the node 

![WCC App41 ](imgs/app41.png)
To restart the server, you can remove the pod and it will restart as the auto start/rollout is enablled in the deployment.

Here is an example screenshot of removing a pod:

![WCC Pod Delete ](imgs/pod-delete.png)

`oc` CLI can also be used for deleteing pods:
first get the name of the pod using

```
$ oc get pods

NAME                         READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
fmw-infrastructure-9-6gx9n   1/1       Running            0          24m
instantclient-1-pvvg7        0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   9          24m
oradb1-9-xcdnl               1/1       Running            0          35m
wccontent-13-6wtp6           1/1       Running            1          26m

```

and then using

```
$ oc delete pod wccontent-13-6wtp6
```


Once the pod is backup you will see the login screen as shown below:

![WCC App4 ](imgs/app4.png)
and the app dashboad:
